    "Time series forecasting consists of predicting future values of a target using earlier observations. In datasets that are used in time series problems, there is an inherent temporal ordering to the data (determined by a time index), and  the sequential target values we're predicting are highly dependent on one another. Feature engineering for time series problems exploits the fact that more recent observations are more predictive than more distant ones.\n",

    "Other time-related concepts in Featuretools will not be relevant here, as this is single table, and time series problems look backwards into the past of an individual column to understand observations within that column, so the concepts of cutoff times and last time indices do not exist in the same way. A cutoff time assumes that non-instantaneous values start at their time index and extend forwards in time. References to that value in child dataframes determine how far forwards that value extends until the last time index is reached.\n",

    "If we are at a point in time `t`, we have access to information from times less than `t` (past instances), and we do not have information from times greater than `t` (future instances). Our limitations in feature engineering, then, will come from when exactly before `t` we have access to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example where we're recording data that takes a week to ingest; the earliest data we have access to is from seven days ago, or `t - 7`. We'll call this our `gap`. A `gap` of 0 would include the instance itself, which we must be careful to avoid in time series problems, as this exposes our target.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to determine how far back in time before `t - 7` we can go. Too far back, and we may lose the potency of our recent observations, but too recent, and we may not capture the full spectrum of behaviors displayed by the data. In this example, let's say that we only want to look at 5 days worth of data at a time. We'll call this our `window_length`. \n",

Yes, using recent temperatures is incredibly predictive in determining future temperatures, but there is also a whole host of historical data suggesting that the month of the year is a pretty good indicator for the temperature outside. However, if we look at the data, we'll see that, though the day changes, the observations are always taken at the same hour, so the `Hour` primitive will not likely be useful. Of course, in a dataset that is measured at an hourly frequency or one more granular, `Hour` may be incrediby predictive. "
